# Project Name
> Building Linear Regression Model for Bike Sharing System 


## General Information
A Bike sharing company that has a dataset containing the bike information of American market. It wishes to use the data to increase the revenue based on important factors in the dataset.

Essentially, the company wants â€”

To understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes

How well those variables describe the bike demands

So interpretation is important!


## Conclusions

Created Generalized Linear Regression model with 82% R2 value.
Only 5% difference between Training R2 and Predicting Test R2.
Temp, Weathersit3 and Year are the top3 features of the model.
